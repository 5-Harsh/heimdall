Project Heimdall

Heimdall | Guardian of Asgard, God of War & Watchman of Bifrost
So i wanted to create a auth based reuseable code.
so that we need not to spend time on reinventing the wheel every single time
create a advance auth system
capable of doing jwt and csr based authentication
also able to provide google and other third party singups

also should have its own default login and registration page and
if else we can directly use its login and registration apis for integrating with projects
also some standard route protecting mechanism such 
to keep the internal routes protected at all costs!!

Happy Hacking HRJ!
